## License and Copyrights

See `LICENSE.txt` for license.

All app source code and assets copyright ¬© 2014-2019 by MyMonero. All rights reserved.


## Downloads

Developers and pre-release testers who would like to use and work on the app can run it by obtaining the source and running one of the build commands below.

To get set up with the source code, please see **Getting the Source Code** below.


## Requirements & Install Locations

The desktop app is built on [Electron](https://electron.atom.io) and can be packaged to run on modern versions of:

* MacOS (.app)
* Windows (installer .exe)
* Linux (.appimage)

### Where is user data saved?

* Desktop: See Electron's [`app.getPath('userData')`](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/app.md#appgetpathname)

* Browser: None (no data is saved)



## Reporting Bugs & Making Feature Requests

If you would like to report an issue or share a feature request, please create a Github [Issue](https://github.com/mymonero/monero-app-js/issues) on this project.

If you're reporting a bug, be sure to include all information which we would need to reproduce the issue, such as the operating system and app version on which you saw the bug, and the steps you took, if you can tell. 

Please don't use the Issues tracker for general support or inquiries. You can also [contact us](https://mymonero.com/support) directly.


# Contributing & Testing


## Getting the Source Code

### Download & Install

1. First, ensure that you have recent versions of `node` and `npm` installed.

2. Clone or otherwise download this repository. Then, in your terminal, `cd` into the repo directory.

3. (To get the bleeding edge, and/or if you are going to make changes) Switch to the `develop` branch by executing `git checkout develop`.

4. **NEW** Be sure to set up and download all required Git submodules with `bin/update_submodules`. 

	* Note: At present, run this command after pulling this repo as necessary to keep all sub-modules up-to-date. 

5. Install all required `node_modules` by executing `npm install`.

#### On Debian/Ubuntu/Linux

* It has been reported that Debian/Ubuntu now calls the `node` binary `nodejs`. One workaround is to create a symlink from /usr/bin/nodejs to /usr/bin/node.

* libgconf is now a requirement for running Electron under Linux, and can be installed with `apt install libgconf-2-4` (https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/1518)


## Repo Contents Overview
* Executable scripts for common tasks are located in `bin/`

* Local, application source code is located in `local_modules/`. This includes bundled/static third-party "Vendor" libraries such as [EmojiOne](http://emojione.com).

* After installation, non-bundled third-party modules (such as Electron) will be located in `node_modules/`.

* App package and build process info is located in `package.json`.

* This readme is located at `README.md`, and the license is located at `LICENSE.txt`.


## Building for Production

If you're testing a pre-release version of this app and need to verify its behavior in production mode or want to obtain an installable release bundle, see [Packaging the App for Production Mode](./docs/PRODUCTION_BUILDS.md).

If you want to run the browser build which is provided in the releases, simply unzip it, `cd` into the browser_build directory, then run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9100` (replacing the port with one of your choice if needed). Then, open your browser of choice and navigate to `http://localhost:9100`.


## Running in Development Mode

### Desktop

*Does not require you to package, sign, and install the app, and will cause the Developer window to be shown. Certain features, such as URL opening under MacOS, require production build.*

`bin/start_dev_desktop`

### Browser (Web wallet)

`bin/start_dev_browser`

*Note:* This will run the command `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9100` to serve `./browser_build`. After this command completes, open your browser of choice and navigate to `http://localhost:9100`.



## Contributing

### Testing

Please submit any bugs as Issues unless they have already been reported.

Suggestions and feedback are very welcome!


### Developing

If you have an improvement to the codebase and would like to have your code shipped in the production MyMonero app, please submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/), even if it's still a WIP. We try to credit all contributors in app release notes.

Before contributing, please spend a few moments scanning the [technology notes](./docs/TECHNOLOGY.md) to learn about libraries used, reasons behind some architectural choices, and more.

* Merging PRs which involve integrating with any third-party services will require discussion and agreement.  

* We reserve the right to refuse to merge any PRs, such as those which introduce breaking changes.

The maintainer enjoys collaborating with volunteer contributors to the MyMonero apps over IRC private message and the #mymonero room on freenode.net (Come say hello!), so PR'd submissions do not have to be at all complete or perfect on their first submission. (To submit a draft PR for review, simply mark it as '[DO NOT MERGE]')

For background on this project, see [Why We Built the Native Apps](./docs/WHY_NATIVE.md).

You may also like to read the unofficial [Technology Roadmap](./docs/ROADMAP.md) to get a peek at what we're thinking about for the future.

There's also an icebox of ideas, features, improvements, known issues, and other todos waiting to be knocked out which are kept in the [Issues](https://github.com/mymonero/monero-app-js/issues) tracker.
